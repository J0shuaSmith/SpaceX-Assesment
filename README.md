***SpaceX Data Pipeline***

**Pipeline Architecture**

The SpaceX Data Pipeline is designed to extract, process, and load SpaceX launch data into a MySQL database while also storing a processed version in an Amazon S3 bucket. The pipeline consists of several components:

Data Extraction: The pipeline starts by extracting the latest SpaceX launch data from the SpaceX API using a HTTP GET request.

Data Processing: The extracted raw data is then processed to extract relevant information, convert data types, and structure it into a Pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame is then displayed and utilized for further operations.

Data Upload to Amazon S3: The processed DataFrame is converted into the Parquet format and uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 bucket is structured to organize data by year.

Data Loading to MySQL RDS: Simultaneously, the processed DataFrame is loaded into a MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS. Before loading, the pipeline checks if the required table exists and creates it if not. Data is loaded using the LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE MySQL command.



**Data Partitioning Strategy**

S3 Bucket Structure: The processed data is partitioned within the S3 bucket based on the year of the launch. This allows for efficient data retrieval and management, especially when dealing with large volumes of data spanning multiple years.

MySQL Table: Although not explicitly partitioned within the table structure, the MySQL table creation occurs dynamically within the pipeline, ensuring the table exists before loading data. This allows for flexibility in handling schema changes and ensures data integrity.



**Operational Procedures**

AWS Configuration: Ensure proper configuration of AWS credentials (access key, secret key) and region settings for S3 bucket access and MySQL RDS connection.

Dependencies Installation: Make sure all necessary dependencies (Prefect, pandas, boto3, pymysql, etc.) are installed in the environment where the pipeline is executed.

Error Handling: The pipeline incorporates error handling mechanisms such as retries using tenacity library to deal with transient failures during data loading.

Security: Secure sensitive information such as AWS credentials, database passwords, and other access keys. Avoid hardcoding these credentials directly into the code. Utilize environment variables or secure credential management services.

Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging mechanisms to track pipeline execution, monitor for errors, and capture relevant metrics. Tools like CloudWatch logs and Prefect's built-in logging capabilities can be utilized for this purpose.

Testing and Validation: Perform thorough testing of the pipeline components, including data extraction, processing, and loading. Validate data integrity and accuracy at each stage to ensure the pipeline functions as expected.

Scheduled Execution: Schedule the pipeline to run at appropriate intervals based on the frequency of data updates and business requirements. Tools like Prefect's scheduling feature or external schedulers like Airflow can be used for this purpose.

Maintenance and Updates: Regularly review and update the pipeline codebase to accommodate changes in data sources, schema modifications, or improvements in processing logic. Ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruptions during updates.

Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation covering pipeline architecture, dependencies, operational procedures, troubleshooting steps, and any other relevant information for onboarding new team members and facilitating future maintenance.
